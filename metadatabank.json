Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan and a team of pioneering animal behaviorists join forces to explore stories of animal lives \"told\" by the animals themselves.  A NATURE miniseries Animals with Cameras showcases a side of the animal kingdom where human cameramen can't go, when animals become the cinematographers.  Using the specially-designed cameras, sprint across the savanna with a cheetah, plunge into the ocean with a seal, and swing through the trees with a chimpanzee.  We will be privy to their secret lives like never before and uncover some truly unprecedented behavior through their eyes.  Each episode features three different species.Ep 1: The astonishing collar-camera footage reveals newborn Kalahari Meerkats below ground for the first time, unveils the hunting skills of Magellanic penguins in Argentina, and follows the treetop progress of an orphaned chimp in Cameroon.Ep 2: The cameras capture young cheetahs learning to hunt in Namibia, reveal how fur seals of an Australian island evade the Great white sharks offshore, and help solve a conflict between South African farmers and Chacma baboons.Ep 3: We deep-dive with Chilean devil rays in the Azores, track Brown bears' diet in Turkey, and follow dogs protecting flocks of sheep from gray wolves in Southern France.",

The investigation charts the largest government bailout in U.S. history, a series of decisions that rewrote the rules of government and fueled a debate that would alter the country’s political landscape. Focusing on the Obama administration, FRONTLINE tells the story of a newly elected president with a mandate for change grappling with the multi-headed menace of economic instability, and with fundamental choices about winners and losers and the direction of his presidency.",

The series listens in as owners recount tales of family heirlooms, yard sale bargains and long-neglected items salvaged from attics and basements, while appraisers reveal the fascinating truth about these finds. Along the way, host Chris Jussel introduces viewers to important historical and cultural sites on each of the thirteen stops, while featured appraisers offer essays and tips on many aspects of collecting. The first episode tours Chicago, Illinois, where experts from the nation's top auction houses look for silver, American furniture, fine paintings, and great toys and games. Chris Jussel surveys the Windy City from the vantage point of its lakefront. He explores Chicago's history, from its Native American roots, to the Great Fire of 1871, to its triumphant comeback. At the Odeum Sports and Expo Center, appraisers are excited about a number of rare finds, including an early 19th-century military rifle and a document signed by George Washington. Also featured is a tour of the home and studio of architect Frank Lloyd Wright.",

The speech, delivered exactly one-year prior to the date of  his assassination, is considered pivotal but often under-appreciated. King challenged the morality of the Vietnam conflict and urged a national discussion about the role of America in the world. Tavis Smiley examines the context of Dr. King's words on liberty, responsibility and freedom against the backdrop of the fight for civil rights and an increasingly unpopular war, and examines the implications of his words today, particularly in light of President Obama's decision to increase U.S. troops in Afghanistan.",

The series listens in as owners recount tales of family heirlooms, yard sale bargains and long-neglected items salvaged from attics and basements, while appraisers reveal the fascinating truth about these finds. Along the way, host Chris Jussel introduces viewers to important historical and cultural sites on each of the thirteen stops, while featured appraisers offer essays and tips on many aspects of collecting. The first episode tours Chicago, Illinois, where experts from the nation's top auction houses look for silver, American furniture, fine paintings, and great toys and games. Chris Jussel surveys the Windy City from the vantage point of its lakefront. He explores Chicago's history, from its Native American roots, to the Great Fire of 1871, to its triumphant comeback. At the Odeum Sports and Expo Center, appraisers are excited about a number of rare finds, including an early 19th-century military rifle and a document signed by George Washington. Also featured is a tour of the home and studio of architect Frank Lloyd Wright.",

The investigation charts the largest government bailout in U.S. history, a series of decisions that rewrote the rules of government and fueled a debate that would alter the country’s political landscape. Focusing on the Obama administration, FRONTLINE tells the story of a newly elected president with a mandate for change grappling with the multi-headed menace of economic instability, and with fundamental choices about winners and losers and the direction of his presidency.",
